# üìùNOTE THAT:
THIS IS THE INTERFACE OF THE VECTOR WITH THIS INTERFACE YOU CAN MANIPULATE THE VECTOR. IF YOU WANT MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION JUST SEE THE vector.h and Macros.h for how things are done
also this vector accepts only elements that are nothrow destructible.

# ‚öôÔ∏èMember functions
1) default constructor just initializes the vector pretty much the default state of the vector: no elements no capacity no size

2) a constructor that takes a capacity argument and just gives the vector this capacity or one if the capacity arg is equal to 0

3) this is the copy constructor that just  copies all the contents from other (this is a deep copy) also the vector takes the size and capacity of other

4) this is pretty much the same case as above but this time we have an initializer list and we take copies of the values of the initializer list

5) this is the move constructor we just steal the contets of the other and we leave it in a valid state it just a vector with zero capacity and size
   
6) capacity function just gives the capacity of the vector how many elements the vector currently can hold

7) empty functions just gives if the vector has size==0 or not simple

8) size function just give the size of the  elements that are in the vector right now not how many can hold the vector itself

9) push_back just pushes  an element by copy or move to the vector, if the vector doesn't have enough capacity size==capacity then we reallocate a new vector that has capacity doubled over the previous, if something goes wrong push_back does nothing (strong guarantee)

10) emplace_back does the same thing as push_back the only difference is that it just constructs the element in place and then pushes it back simple

11) pop_back just pops the last element from the vector reduces size by one and doesn't change the capacity no matter how many elements you pop, if you wanna change the capacity if you popped enough elements just use shrink_to_fit

12) show justs prints all the elements in the vector uses this func if the elements are printable (we can call cout in them

13) operator [] we use it just to access the vector and change its contents this doesn't check in release if you passed valid index(use with care)

14) at function this func we use it for the same purpose as operator [] but we check if the index is valid and then we throw for invalid indexes

15) destructor function justs destroys the vector and frees the memory and all the size=capacity=0

16) clear function it just deletes all the elements in the vector but doesn't affect capacity it justs affects size and makes it 0

17) front function it just gives the first element of the vector it doesn't check on release if the vector has any elements (use with care)

18)back function it just gives the last element of the vector it doesn't check on release if the vector has any elements (use with care)

19) swap functions just swaps the contents of two vectors

20)reserve just changes the capacity of the vector if you give a greater capacity of what the vector currently has, if something goes wrong  reserve doesn't do anything (strong guarantee)

21) shrink_to_fit function just shrinks the capacity of the vector to be equal to the size  of the vector, if something goes wrong shrink_to_fit doesn't do anything (strong guarantee)

22) resize function first overload :
    1. if the size==new_size then nothing happents
    2. if the size>new_size then we pop the elements from the vector we don't change the capacity
    3. if the size<new_size we push_back the default constructible objects of type _Ty if the new_size is greater than capacity we also reallocate space this func may change the state of the vector, if something goes wrong see implementation
23) resize function second overload does the same thing as the first overload but in the third scenario it pushes copy constructible objects of type _Ty on the vector(the only difference)

24) copy operator just makes a deep copy of the other vector if something goes wrong copy operator doesn't do anything (strong guarantee) see implementation for more details, but pretty much is creates another vector same as the other and if it all goes good we dealloc our old vector and take this one

25) assign function pretty much it creates a vector with size and capacity=count and values same as the value passed as arg ,if something goes wrong assign doesn't do anything (strong guarantee), if all goes good we dealloc our old vector and take this one

26) move operator we pretty much dealloc our vector and take the contents of the other if we accidentaly move to ourselves we lose our contents be careful with this func

27) operator with initializer_list pretty much does the same thing as the copy operator but the other is now an initializer list and not a vector,if something goes wrong this function doesn't do anything (strong guarantee)

28) data function gives access to the underlying vector pretty much :
Returns a pointer to the internal array of pointers.
The vector retains ownership of the objects.
Users may read or modify the objects via the pointers, but must NOT delete them.
29) insert function it just inserts an element to the following position with copy or move and shifts other elements from index and after one position right (classic insertion to an array ),if something goes wrong the state of the vector may change see implementation details

30) emplace function does the same thing with insert function but this time it constructs the object passed in place no other difference

31) erase function just removes an element from the vector at the given position and it just shifts the remaining elements from the index and after one position left (classic erase to an array)

32) begin,cbegin,cend,end are there for the iterator interface

# üîó ITERATOR API üåê :
# üìùNOTE THAT:
USE MUST ONLY MAKE THE ITERATOR POINT TO A VALID VECTOR ON STACK DECLARED OR IN HEAP DO NOT USE AN ITERATOR WHEN IT IS INVALID MAKE IT POINT TO A VALID OBJECT ONLY OR THE BEHAVIOR IS UNDEFINED
,ALSO THIS CLASS IS EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT
# ‚öôÔ∏èMEMBER FUNCTIONS:
1) default constructor initializes the default state of the iterator

2) copy constructor which is =default function

3) move constructor which is =default function

4) copy operator  just makes iterator point where the other iterator is pointing

5) move operator just makes iterator point where the other iterator is pointing again

6) OPERATOR ++ INCREASES THE POSITION OF ITERATOR BY ONE IF IT IN THE RANGE [0,SIZE-1] OF THE VECTOR THAT IT POINTS

7) OPERATOR != TO SEE IF ITERATOS POINT TO THE SAME OBJECT AND AT THE SAME POSITION OR THE POINT SOMEWHERE ELSE

8) OPERATOR == SAME CASE AS OPERATOR!=

9) OPERATOR * IN ORDER TO DEREFERENCE WHERE THE ITERATOR POINTS NOTE THAT THE ITERATOR MUST BE VALID (MUST BE IN THE RANGE [0,SIZE-1]

10) OPERATOR += SAME CASE AS OPERATOR ++ BUT THIS TIME WE INCREMENT BY A COUNTER

11) OPERATOR -> IS USED IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE METHODS (IF IT HAS ANY OF THE OBJECT) THAT ITERATOR POINTS IN THE CONTAINER

12) OPERATOR + SAME CASE AS OPERATOR++ AND OPERATOR += BUT IT DOESN'T INCREMENT OPERATOR IT JUST INCREASES A NEW ITERATOR AND RETURNS IT

13) OPERATOR -- SAME CASE BUT THIS TIME WE GO BACKWARDS WE CAN ONLY MOVE IF WE ARE AT THE INDEX (0,SIZE]

14) OPERATOR - SAME CASE AS OPERATOR +

15) OPERATOR -= SAME CASE AS -- BUT THIS TIME WE DECREMENT BY A COUNTER

16) OPERATOR [] TO ACCESS THE ITERATOR LIKE AN ARRAY BUT THIS FUNC TAKES THE INDEX WE GIVE AND SEES IF THE INDEX WE GIVE + WHERE THE ITERATOR POINTS IS VALID AND THEN WE SEE IF IT IN THE RANGE [0,SIZE-1]

17) THE DESTRUCTOR RESETS THE ITERATOR AGAIN AT ITS DEFAULT STATE SIMPLE ENOUGH

# üìùNOTE THAT :
THE CONST ITERATOR HAS EXACTLY THE SAME IMPLEMENTATION AS THE ITERATOR BUT FOR THE ACCESS WE CAN ONLY READ THE ITEM THAT THE ITERATOR POINTS AND WE CANNOT CHANGE IT
